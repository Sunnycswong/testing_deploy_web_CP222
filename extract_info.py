Include the relationship history and the strategic rationale for the credit request, alongside the details of the proposed credit structure.

        The executive summary should contain:
        1. A clear depiction of the proposed credit structure. Example: XYZ Corporation has successfully negotiated a structured credit facility of $10 million with a 5-year term and a fixed interest rate of 4.5% annually. The repayment schedule is based on a quarterly amortization plan ensuring manageable cash outflows while gradually reducing the principal balance. The loan is secured by the company's commercial real estate assets, providing the lender with a tangible guarantee. Adherence to financial covenants, including a minimum debt-service coverage ratio of 1.25x and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.5x, is required to maintain loan terms and prevent default. In the event of early repayment, XYZ Corporation will incur a prepayment penalty of 2% of the outstanding balance to compensate for the lender's interest income loss. The loan carries a subordinated clause, placing it after other senior debts in case of liquidation. Loan administration fees total $50,000, covering the due diligence and ongoing monitoring costs. Funds from the loan are earmarked strictly for the expansion of the company's manufacturing capacity, as per the agreed end-use terms. The loan agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York, ensuring a clear legal framework for both parties.
        2. A summary of the credit proposal, emphasizing the borrower's name, requested credit amount, credit purpose, and credit structure details.

        If details are missing, close your response with a request for additional information using the specified format: "[RM Please provide further information on Keywords...]". Avoid any indication of missing information within the output itself.
