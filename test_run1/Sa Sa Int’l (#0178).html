<h2>Industrial Analysis</h2>
<p>
  Sa Sa International operates in the beauty product retail sector in Asia,
  specifically in Hong Kong, Macau SARs, Mainland China, and Malaysia. The
  beauty and personal care market in Hong Kong is projected to reach USD
  2,293.00 million in 2024, with an annual growth rate of 1.99% from 2024 to
  2028. Mainland China is a significant market for imported cosmetics and
  toiletries, with Hong Kong serving as a major entrepôt for these imports. As
  of 2021, more than half of the cosmetics products in China were sold online.
  In 2021, Macau exported USD 39.1 million in beauty products, making it the
  57th largest exporter of beauty products in the world. The beauty and personal
  care market in Malaysia is projected to reach USD 3.24 billion in 2024. The
  beauty and personal care market is on an upward trajectory across all
  categories and has proven to be resilient amid global economic crises and in a
  turbulent macroeconomic environment. The primary competitors of SaSa
  International in the cosmetics industry include Sephora, Teletext Holidays,
  Watson's and Bonjour. Sephora is a French multinational retailer of personal
  care and beauty products. It carries nearly 340 brands, including its own
  private label, Sephora Collection. The company is known for its quality
  products, technological advancements in the makeup sector, and its firm stance
  on Human Rights. Sephora has a strong reputation and is one of the biggest
  names in the beauty industry. Teletext Holidays was a British travel company
  that specialized in the sale of short and long haul beach holidays, city
  breaks, UK getaways, and cruises. However, the company ceased trading as of 29
  October 2021. The overall rating of Teletext Holidays was 3.8, with Work-Life
  balance being rated at the top and given a rating of 3.7. However, Job
  Security was rated the lowest at 2.9. The company had some controversy as it
  avoided giving refunds to customers during COVID and kept the money. Watsons
  is the flagship health and beauty brand of A.S. Watson Group and is one of the
  longest-standing brands in Hong Kong and the world. It sets high standards in
  the health, wellness, and beauty market, providing personalized advice and
  counseling in health. Watsons is a significant part of the daily lives and
  communities of the public. The company has a history filled with love and
  countless touching moments, and love has always been the driving force for
  their continuous improvement. Bonjour Holdings Limited (Chinese: 卓悅控股) is
  a Hong Kong-based investment holding company principally engaged in the sales
  of beauty products. The company was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in
  2003. As of 2019, the chain has 39 retail stores in Hong Kong (35), Macau (3),
  and Guangzhou (1).Bonjour's annual revenue totaled HK$1.79 billion for the
  fiscal year ending in December 2018
