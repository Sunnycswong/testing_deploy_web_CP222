<h2>Industrial Analysis</h2>
<p>
  New World Group operates in the property sector, primarily in Greater China,
  especially the Greater Bay Area. The property market in China has been a key
  driver of the economy, contributing between 17 to 29 percent of GDP. However,
  the market has been experiencing a slowdown since 2019. In 2022, investment in
  real estate development dropped by 10.0% year-on-year to RMB13.3 trillion,
  while residential investment fell by 9.5% year-on-year to RMB10.1 trillion.
  The property sector in China has been facing challenges due to a shifting
  regulatory landscape and deteriorating economic conditions. The future outlook
  for the property sector in Greater China is challenging, with a prolonged
  slowdown expected. However, there are signs of potential recovery in the
  longer term, with gradual stabilisation expected in the higher-tier cities,
  supported by government policies. Property sales are expected to follow an
  extended L-shaped recovery, with sales projected to drop about 5% in 2024. The
  players in the same industry as NWD Group include Sun Hung Kai Properties,
  Cheung Kong Holdings, and Henderson Land Development. Sun Hung Kai Properties
  is one of the largest property companies in Hong Kong, specializing in
  developing premium quality residential projects, and owning an extensive
  network of shopping malls and offices, as well as a hotel portfolio. The
  company was established in 1969 and was listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange
  in 1983. Cheung Kong Holdings, now part of CK Hutchison Holdings, is a
  multinational conglomerate based in Hong Kong. It was one of Hong Kong's
  leading multi-national conglomerates. The company merged with its subsidiary
  Hutchison Whampoa on 3 June 2015, as part of a major reorganisation. It was
  founded by Li Ka-shing and has developed into a dominant property development
  company in Hong Kong, with a series of residential and commercial properties.
  Henderson Land Development Co. Ltd. is a listed property developer in Hong
  Kong and a constituent of the Hang Seng Index. The company's principal
  activities are property development and investment, project management,
  construction, hotel operation, department store operation, and finance.
  Henderson Land is an award-winning property group with businesses in Hong Kong
  and throughout mainland China. All three companies, like NWD Group, are major
  players in the real estate industry in Hong Kong, with a focus on property
  development and investment. They all have a significant presence in both Hong
  Kong and mainland China.
