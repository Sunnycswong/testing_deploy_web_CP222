<p>New World Group operates in the property sector, primarily in Greater China, especially the Greater Bay Area. The property market in China has been a key driver of the economy, contributing between 17 to 29 percent of GDP. However, the market has been experiencing a slowdown since 2019. In 2022, investment in real estate development dropped by 10.0% year-on-year to RMB13.3 trillion, while residential investment fell by 9.5% year-on-year to RMB10.1 trillion. The property sector in China has been facing challenges due to a shifting regulatory landscape and deteriorating economic conditions. The future outlook for the property sector in Greater China is challenging, with a prolonged slowdown expected. However, there are signs of potential recovery in the longer term, with gradual stabilisation expected in the higher-tier cities, supported by government policies. Property sales are expected to follow an extended L-shaped recovery, with sales projected to drop about 5% in 2024.</p>
