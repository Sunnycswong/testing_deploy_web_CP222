<h2>Industrial Analysis</h2>
<p>
  China Evergrande operates in the real estate sector in China. The real estate
  market in China is projected to grow by 3.06% from 2024 to 2028, resulting in
  a market volume of USD 153.10 trillion in 2028. The nationwide net absorption
  of office space is expected to reach 6.2 million sq. m. in 2022, driven by the
  tech and finance sectors. However, the residential property sales may decline
  by about 5% in 2023 due to the time needed for the economy and prospective
  homebuyers' incomes to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The real estate
  market in China is expected to reach a value of USD 135.70 trillion in 2024.
