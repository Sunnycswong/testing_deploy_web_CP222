<p>China Evergrande operates in the real estate sector in China. The real estate market in China is projected to grow by 3.06% from 2024 to 2028, resulting in a market volume of USD 153.10 trillion in 2028. The nationwide net absorption of office space is expected to reach 6.2 million sq. m. in 2022, driven by the tech and finance sectors. However, the residential property sales may decline by about 5% in 2023 due to the time needed for the economy and prospective homebuyers' incomes to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The real estate market in China is expected to reach a value of USD 135.70 trillion in 2024.</p>
