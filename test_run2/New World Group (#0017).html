<p>On the other hand, the term "New World" is commonly used to describe the majority of lands in the Western Hemisphere, particularly the Americas. It gained prominence during Europe's Age of Discovery in the early 16th century. The term "New World" refers to the lands discovered by European explorers, which were previously unknown to them. It expanded the geographical horizon of earlier European geographers who believed that the world only included Afro-Eurasian lands. The Americas were then referred to as the "New World" while Africa, Asia, and Europe were collectively called the "Old World" [^2^].</p>
