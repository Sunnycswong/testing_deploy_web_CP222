However, due to ICBCA business scale, network plus OIC’s marketing effort and cordial relationship, Pamfleet agreed to provide an industry / office acquisition project for our consideration. In this project, Pamfleet is to cooperate with Angelo Gordon Group (“Angelo Gordon”), a US investment company dedicated to alternative investment to form a fund, which will be used to acquire Ever Gain Plaza located in Kwai Chung (the “Property”) or the companies holding the Property."

Kwai Chung has been transforming from a traditional industrial district into a secondary office hub. The area is gradually being repositioned as a logistics and data centre hub due to its strategic location near Hong Kong’s major container ports and Hong Kong International Airport.The Kwai Chung office market had a supply spike in 2006 and mid-2008, due to the completion of Nina Tower and Kowloon Commerce Centre Tower 1. This supply offered a critical mass of Grade-A office space. With an increasing number of multi-national corporations and major occupiers attracted to the area, the vacancy rate has dropped significantly.

        "Example": "Despite the relatively slow external trade environment during early 2012, sentiment in the industrial market remained positive. This came on the back of improved domestic consumption and robust retail sales supported by mainland visitors, which translated into leasing demand for logistic centres and warehouse storage space. In the factories and industrial/office leasing market, demand continued to be driven by cost conscious tenants who were attracted by cheaper rents. The market also witnessed more relocation demand from occupiers impacted by industrial revitalization or redevelopment plans of not only storage facilities, but also factory and industrial/office buildings. This pushed the existing tenants to other industrial facilities where vacant space is available. On the supply front, the market witnessed the completion and official opening of Interlink, Goodman’s latest storage facility in Tsing Yi. It is the fourth biggest warehouse in Hong Kong, and is the largest development over the past decade with around 2.4 million sq ft. On the back of a prolonged shortage of prime new supply in the market, space in the development was quickly absorbed and the facility was almost fully leased out prior to completion."

One of the key risks is the borrower's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations due to their international operations. To mitigate this risk, the borrower has implemented a hedging strategy, utilizing forward contracts to lock in exchange rates for a portion of their foreign currency transactions. This strategy provides stability and minimizes the impact of adverse currency movements on their profitability. Another risk is the borrower's heavy reliance on a single key customer, which poses a concentration risk. To address this, the borrower is actively diversifying their customer base by targeting new markets and industries, thereby reducing their dependency on a single client. Additionally, the borrower has established long-term contracts with key customers to secure recurring revenue streams and maintain stable cash flows. These risk mitigation measures enhance the borrower's ability to withstand potential challenges and ensure the sustainability of their business."
